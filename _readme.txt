Prob 2 of Lab 5 is a design exercise.
The teaacher works through the file DuckDemo.pdf (making use
of the file Teacher Notes for the Duck Application.pdf) to 
arrive at a proposed class diagram for the Duck application.

Students then receive startup code and requirements that 
lead to an implementation of the design.
